Certainly! The **Flames game** is a fun way to playfully assess the compatibility between two people. Let's dive into how it works:

1. **Enter Two Names**:
    - You can enter any two names (yours and someone else's, or even fictional characters).
    - For example, let's use the names **Sarah** and **David**.

2. **Remove Duplicates**:
    - Eliminate any repeated letters that appear in both names.
    - In our example, after removing duplicates, we have **SarahD**.

3. **Count Remaining Letters**:
    - Count the total number of remaining letters after removing duplicates.
    - In our example, the letter count is **5**.

4. **Flame Calculation**:
    - Use the following table to eliminate pairs of matching letters with each step:
        - **F**: Friendship
        - **L**: Love
        - **A**: Affection
        - **M**: Marriage
        - **E**: Enemy (not a good sign!)
        - **S**: Sibling

5. **Outcome**:
    - Continue eliminating letters based on the count.
    - In our example:
        - **S**arahDavi**D** (F)
        - **S**arah**D**avi (L)
        - **Sa**rah**D** (A)
        - **Sa**rah (M)
        - **Sa** (E)

    - The final remaining letter is **E**, which corresponds to the outcome: **Enemies**.

Remember, this game is all in good fun and shouldn't be taken too seriously! ðŸ˜„
